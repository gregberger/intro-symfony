# Les routes et controlleurs

## Controlleurs
> In Symfony, a controller is usually a class method which is used to accept requests, and return a Response object. 
> When mapped with a URL, a controller becomes accessible and its response can be viewed.
> To facilitate the development of controllers, Symfony provides an AbstractController. 
> It can be used to extend the controller class allowing access to some frequently used utilities such as render() and redirectToRoute(). 
> The `AbstractController` also provides the `createNotFoundException()` utility which is used to return a page not found response.
